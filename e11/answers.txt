Q1 In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()? Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere. (No need to time it, unless you really want to.)

I .cache() the average and max score of comment, using cache to temporarily store data allows the program to run faster without having to calculate the same steps over and over again.

Q2 How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?
with hint():
real	2m1.456s
user	1m8.189s
sys	0m4.961s

without hint():
real	2m50.680s
user	1m12.717s
sys	0m5.433s

Using broadcast will run faster which improves "best author" program.
