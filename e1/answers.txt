Q1 Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?

For the first three parts, I think the difficulty of the code parts of numpy and pandas are similar. But numpy's reshape function can better reshape the format I want, while pandas only has pivot and melt functions to reshape the data. So I think while pandas' data tables are easier to navigate, numpy's code is more free.



Q2 What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?

pivot_months_pandas: 5.42 ms ± 159 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)
pivor_months_loops: 103 ms ± 376 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)
I learned that pandas is built on top of numpy, which is written in c and is highly optimized for performance. So the efficiency of python loops is not at all comparable to that of numpy, making the difference in time spent quite large.
